# Crappy Chat App üí¨

## Introduction
Welcome to the Crappy Chat App, the messaging platform that Mr. Big secretly believes is the best out there. In reality, it's as crappy as it can get, but let's keep that between us. Shh, don't tell Mr. Big! ü§´

## Mr. Big's Fear of Python üêç
In Mr. Big's kingdom, Python is a mysterious language that he's scared of. There were no Abendkurs sessions for Python, so it's like a mythical creature to him. Despite this fear, our Crappy Chat App is here to prove that Python can be both scary and crappily amazing!

## Rules üìú
1. No fire allowed. Mr. Big is still scared of it, especially if it's written in Python. We don't want the chat to turn into a fiery mess ‚Äì that's a different app altogether!
2. Try not to invent any new tools; it confuses Mr. Big. Stick to the basics, like rocks and sticks. We're not reinventing the wheel; we're just trying to keep it square.
3. Your code must be approved by the tribe council (aka pull request reviews). If Mr. Big nods, you're good to go! Just beware, his nods might be mistaken for a slight nod-off from time to time.

## How to Contribute ü§ù
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create your own cave (branch).
3. Add your shiny tools (code).
4. Make an offering to the council (pull request). Don't worry; Mr. Big will only critique your Python if he understands it, which is highly unlikely.

## Credits üëè
Special thanks to Mr. Big for pretending to understand the `return` statement last week. We are forever in your confusion.

## Genius Features ü§ì
Here are some of the unique features you'll find in our Chat App:

- **Remember the Past**: Because who wants the Userlist to actually update when someone leaves?
- **No Message Backups**: Once sent, your messages will only stay as long as the app runs. For security and privacy reasons of course!
- **Message in a Bottle**: Your messages may or may not get lost at sea ‚Äì adds an element of surprise!
- **Cryptic Errors**: Our error messages are so cryptic; even Mr. Big can't decipher them.

## Troubleshooting üíª
Having issues with the app? Here are the most common solutions:

1. **Turn it Off and On Again**: A classic, but surprisingly effective. If it doesn't work the first time, try turning off your computer, leaving the room, and pretending you never tried in the first place.
2. **Blame Mr. Big**: If all else fails, it's probably Mr. Big's fault. He might not understand Python, but he definitely understands the blame game.
3. **Shout into the Void**: Sometimes, the app just needs to hear your frustration. Open your window and shout, "Why won't you work, you craptastic piece of code!" If that doesn't fix it, at least the neighbors will know about your struggles.
4. **Consult the Oracle**: Ask a random question on Stack Overflow and hope for the best. Warning: This may lead to even more confusion.
5. **Offer a Sacrifice to the Coding Gods**: Build a small bonfire, sacrifice a USB cable, and chant ancient coding spells. Results may vary, but it's worth a shot.
6. **Check the Moon Phase**: Believe it or not, the phases of the moon can affect the app's performance. If it's a full moon, blame lunar interference and try again tomorrow.
7. **Pet a Cat**: Studies have shown that petting a cat can reduce stress, even when dealing with crappy code. If you don't have a cat, try petting a plush toy. Results may also vary.

**Important Note**: The chat app may occasionally burst into flames, but that's just a feature, not a bug! Brought to you by the future tech geniuses of year 12. Let's pass the Abitur without becoming cavemen, even if our chat app is a bit crappy!
